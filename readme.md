Sage implementations for the optimization of the attack parameters and security estimates for the classical and quantum hybrid attack provided in [2] by Thomas Wunderer. Parts of the implementation are based on a previous implementation for the security estimates of [1] by Florian Goepfert, Rachel Player, and Thomas Wunderer.
